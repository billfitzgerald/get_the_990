# 1. Summarize data from Form 990s

Parse and summarize data from ProPublica's NonProfit Explorer at https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/

All nonprofits are required to submit Form 990s. These forms contain interesting information, but it's often buried deep in the report, and it's hard to dig out.

Additionally, it's not easy to compare multiple forms side by side (ie, you want to compare one org across multiple years, or you want to compare two or more orgs).

If you are doing research into nonprofits, **Get the 990** is for you!

# 2. Features

**Get the 990** uses data shared and maintained in ProPublica's Nonprofit Explorer. ProPublica shares the data in multiple formats, including PDF downloads and via XML. **Get the 990** uses the XML to pull out a subset of data from the Form 990.

# 3. Intended Use Case

**Get the 990** is best used as a preliminary research tool. It is designed to be a starting point to help surface areas that look like they merit additional research. As we have all experienced, researching companies can lead us down rabbit holes. **Get the 990** is intended to make those rabbit holes easier to spot and avoid (or at least make them more shallow).

# 4. Plans and Next Steps

**Get the 990** just scratches the surface of the data that's in a Form 990. The roadmap includes pulling out data on donations to nonprofits, and funding issued by nonprofits.

Pull requests are welcome, as are issues and questions.

# 5. Technical Details

**Get the 990** requires Python 3.6 or higher, and it was developed on Linux. It has not been tested on OSX or Windows.
